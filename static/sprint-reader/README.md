# Sprint Reader

<a href="http://tinyurl.com/lggjhxr">**Sprint Reader**</a> is an easy to use (Google Chrome) speed reading extension. 

> Current (stable) version: 2.5.0

Simply select text on a webpage, right-click and select `Sprint read selected text` from the menu. This will launch the reader window, the selected text is displayed word-by-word in a fixed focal position. The duration of each slide is calculated based upon a word-per-minute (WPM) setting.

This method of reading is known as **Rapid Serial Visual Presentation** or RSVP for short. Studies have shown the habit of internally "sounding out" (sub-vocalising) words is a limiting factor which prevents faster reading speeds from being obtained. RSVP eliminates the "sounding out" of words as individual words are not displayed long enough for sub-vocalisation to occur.

RSVP proves that humans can absorb information much faster than standard reading rates with the same level of comprehension.

## <a name="getting-started"></a>Getting Started

We've made it easy for you to write code and develop new features for Sprint Reader. **To start: Download the source code** and load the extension into Google Chrome (Developer mode).

From the official [Google Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) website:

> Extensions that you download from the Chrome Web Store are packaged up as .crx files, which is great for distribution, but not so great for development. Recognizing this, Chrome gives you a quick way of loading up your working directory for testing. Let's do that now.

> 1. Visit `chrome://extensions` in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu by clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox. The menu's icon is three horizontal bars.. and select **Extensions** under the **Tools** menu to get to the same place).
> 2. Ensure that the **Developer mode** checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
> 3. Click **Load unpacked extension…** to pop up a file-selection dialog.
> 4. Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live, and select it.

> Alternatively, you can drag and drop the directory where your extension files live onto `chrome://extensions` in your browser to load it.

> If the extension is valid, it'll be loaded up and active right away! If it's invalid, an error message will be displayed at the top of the page. Correct the error, and try again.

Once you've loaded Sprint Reader into Google Chrome you can begin to edit code and add functionality! _Good luck and keep us updated with what you're planning to add / achieve / fix!_
